gmail-message-mode
==========

**gmail-message-mode** is an emacs major-mode for editing gmail
messages using markdown syntax, it is meant for use with browser
plugins which allow you to edit text fields with external applications
(in this case, emacs). See [Plugins][] below for a list for each
browser.

**The problem:** Lately, gmail messages have been demanding html. That
  made it very hard to edit them outside your browser, because you had
  to edit html source code (for instance, linebreaks were ignored and
  you had to type `<br>' instead).

**gmail-message-mode to the rescue:** Simply activate this mode in
  gmail messages (See [Activation][]); the buffer is converted to
  markdown and you may edit at will, but the file is still saved as
  html behind the scenes so GMail won't know a thing! *See
  [ham-mode][1] to understand how this works.*

Activation
----------
Make sure you install it:

    M-x package-install RET gmail-message-mode

And that's it!
*(if you install manually, note that it depends on [ham-mode][1])*

This package will (using `auto-mode-alist') configure emacs to
activate `gmail-message-mode' whenever you're editing a file that
seems to be a gmail message. However, given the wide range of possible
plugins, it's hard to catch them all. You may have to add entries
manually to `auto-mode-alist', to make sure `gmail-message-mode' is
activated.

## Plugins ##

1. **Google-Chrome or Chromium** - [Edit with emacs][]
